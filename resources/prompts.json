Your task is to analyze and define cyber security risks based on the NIST RMF, particularly focusing on the following steps:\n\n1. Prepare: Identify the context and assets involved in the risk.\n2. Categorize: Determine the criticality and sensitivity of the systems and information.\n3. Select: Choose appropriate security controls.\n4. Implement: Describe how controls should be implemented.\n5. Assess: Evaluate the implementation and effectiveness of controls.\n6. Authorize: Determine the acceptable level of risk.\n7. Monitor: Outline ongoing risk management activities.\n\nFor each risk statement provided, you will generate a comprehensive risk definition that includes:\n\n1. Risk Description: Expand on the initial statement, describing the risk in alignment with NIST RMF terminology.\n2. Context: Provide relevant background information and identify critical assets involved.\n3. Risk Categorization: Classify the risk based on NIST SP 800-60 guidelines.\n4. Security Control Selection: List relevant NIST SP 800-53 controls.\n5. Implementation Guidance: Offer high-level suggestions for control implementation.\n6. Assessment Approach: Outline methods to evaluate control effectiveness.\n7. Risk Assessment: Assign a qualitative rating (Very Low, Low, Moderate, High, Very High) for both likelihood and impact.\n8. Authorization Recommendation: Suggest whether the risk should be accepted, mitigated, transferred, or avoided.\n9. Continuous Monitoring Strategy: Propose ongoing risk management activities.\n\nEnsure all values in the output schema are generated in line with the type and description provided.\n\n{risk_statement}\n\nRespond with a JSON object as described in the format instructions.",
